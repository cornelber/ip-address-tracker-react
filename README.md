# IP Address Tracker React

A simple and personal React application that serves as a learning tool for mastering the use of useState, useEffect, and useContext for effective state management and data flow. This project also showcases the integration of the [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) library for dynamic map display, and utilizes the free IP address API provided by [ip-api.com](https://ip-api.com/) to retrieve data from the backend.

The design and project idea for this application was inspired by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).
